        <p>The <a href="http://www.pas.org/pasic.aspx">Percussive Arts Society International Convention (PASIC)</a> is the largest percussion event in the world featuring over 120 concerts, clinics, master classes, labs, workshops, panels and presentations. The PASIC selection process is competitive and rigorous, and seeks to determine a balance of artists, musical genres and instrumentation. Each year more than 500 applications are received as proposals for presenting a session at the next year's PASIC, and in some categories it is common that the ratio of applications received to the total number of available sessions in that category exceeds 8 to 1. The convention's International Drum and Percussion Expo has more than 120 exhibitors showcasing the latest in percussion instruments, gear, publications and services.</p>
